Use a Simple Shortcode to show star-ratings with your blog posts. Manipulate ratings, counts with ease. Get better CTR and Search Engine Rankings.

After installing the plugin use the shortcode anywhere (including classic editor & Block Editor) by using this format:
`[rated stars="4.3" by="23"]`

Here `stars` represent the star value out of 5, `by` is the number of user-ratings you want to show.

By default, if you use `[rated]` shortcode only, it will take 5 star rating value with 2 review counts.
