> Download the plugin and install it to your WordPress website.
Once you are done, use the shortcode `[rated]` anywhere (including classic editor & Block Editor) by using this format:

`[rated stars="4.3" by="23"]`
Here stars represent the star value out of 5, by is the number of user-ratings you want to show. Change the values the way you want, but remember that the best rating is 5, so the value must be in the range of 1.0 to 5.0.

By default, if you use `[rated]` shortcode only, it will take a 5 star rating value with 2 votes (review counts).
